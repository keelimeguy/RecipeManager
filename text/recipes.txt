Clicking on a recipe in a list will allow you to view its details. Press the left or right arrow buttons at the top of this recipe viewing mode (or use the left and right arrow keys on your keyboard) to cycle through the recipes from the list. You can edit recipes pressing the "Edit Recipe" button. Recipes are created when clicking the "Create Recipe" button from a recipe list or by changing the name of a recipe while editing.

You should note that if you wish to change the name of a recipe you should delete the original recipe after editing. If you don't see the confirmation window for overwriting the recipe, then a new recipe was created and the original recipe was.

While viewing recipes, if a paragraph would overflow the width of the screen, it will wrap to the following line instead. The program attempts to fit all recipes within the given window size. If the window was resized by the user, pressing the "Refresh" button near the top of the window will re-fit the recipe into the window.

A recipe consists of these fields:
- A name for the recipe
- The amount of servings the recipe produces
    This amount should be a positive integer. If the value is 0 then it will be replaced with "-" while viewing.
- The estimated preparation time for the recipe
    This prep time should be a positive real number or zero and is always measured in minutes.
- The estimated cooking time for the recipe
    This cook time should be a positive real number or zero and is always measured in minutes.
- A description for the recipe
- A list of ingredients for the recipe
    The order of the ingredients in the list box during creation corresponds to the order they appear when viewing.
- Directions for preparing the recipe
    Typing "^o" (a carat followed by a lowercase 'O') will give you a quick temperature degree symbol.

Invalid fields will fail the recipe submission and be highlighted red to indicate an error.


Adding Ingredients:

    To add an ingredient, fill in the amount, unit, and name fields then press the "+" button. Selecting an ingredient
    in the list and pressing "-" will remove that ingredient. The program will mark an error while adding an ingredient
    that already exists in the list. If you wish to edit an ingredient already in the list you must remove it first.

    Selecting an ingredient will auto fill the input fields with the information for that ingredient. Be aware that this will overwrite any info that was previously typed into the fields. When an ingredient was not added due to an error, shown by a red highlighted region in the input fields, then selecting an ingredient in the list will not overwrite the field. An example use of this feature is the following:
        - select an ingredient, to edit
        - edit the unit or amount in the input fields
        - attempt to add th editied ingredient by pressing "+" creating an error as the ingredient already exists
        - select the conflicting ingredient in the list, the input fields will not be overwritten due to the last error
        - add the edited ingredient to the list by pressing "+"

    You may enter fractional amounts like "3/4" or "1 1/2" and the program will be able to parse them. Not all
    fractions are supported, but common measurement values are.

    Pressing tab while in one of the fields will move you to the next field. Pressing space while a button is
    highlighted will activate that button. Using these keyboard shortcuts may make it easier to add recipes quickly,
    compared to selecting fields using the mouse.

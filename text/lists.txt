The "Recipes" list is open automatically when the program first starts. Other lists can be accessed via the "Lists" option in the menu bar.

You can open an element of a list by double clicking on the element. In the "Recipes" list, opening a recipe allows you to view that entire recipe in a neat format. In the "Ingredients" list, opening an ingredient will bring you to the recipe list with a search entry for that ingredient.


Columns:

    Clicking a column header within a list will sort the data according to that column. The sizes of columns can be
    adjusted by dragging the separator between columns, double clicking the separator will automatically resize the
    column to fit the width of its data.

    Columns in the "Recipes" list can be defined by the user. To define the format for columns in the recipe list,
    select the associated option under the "Preferences" menu bar option. This will open a new menu where you can add
    and reorder desired column headers. To enable a column header select it in the left list box and press the ">"
    button. To disable an option select it in the right list box and press the "<" button. The order of the column
    headers in the right list box corresponds to the order the columns are listed in the recipe list. The "Name" column
    is fixed in the first position and cannot be disabled. Notice that the existence of a column in the recipe list
    does not correspond to an ability to search acording to that column. For example, enabling the "Description" column
    header does not mean that you can search according to that field in the search bar. Additionally, disabling the
    "Prep Time" column header does not remove the ability to search according to that field. See the "Searching"
    section for more info on the search bar.

    The "Ingredients" list has two columns, the ingredient name and the number of recipes which use that ingredient.

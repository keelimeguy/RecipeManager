All your recipes are stored within database (.db) files. This program allows you to manage different recipe books in any number of database files. You can load one of these recipe books by clicking "Load" under the "File" option in the menu bar. You can also import all recipes from a selected recipe book into the current recipe book, or export the recipes from the current recipe book to another recipe book.

The default recipe book, which opens at startup, can be changed by selecting the appropriate option under the "Preferences" menu bar option. After startup while the program is running, if this default book is not found at all (by user deletion for example), then it will be created as an empty recipe book at that location. If instead the user removed the directories leading to that file, then the program may quit in error. Restarting the program if this should occur will reset the default database preferences.
